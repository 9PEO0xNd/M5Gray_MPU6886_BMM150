MahonyAHRSupdate function has problems normalization part in acc, mag, q0-q3
copy(overwrite) MahonyAHRS.cpp and MahonyAHRS.h files are own your risk.

wrong
recipNorm = Sqrt
  ?? *= recipNorm;

correct(same as MahonyAHRSupdateIMU)
recipNorm = invSqrt
  ?? *= recipNorm;

correct (not recommended)
recipNorm = Sqrt
  ?? /= recipNorm;
